## Ontology-based conversational agent for analyzing and monitoring person’s emotional state

### Abstract
Emotions that occurs from person’s emotive factors and social interactions play a significant role in our decision-making and personal mood. Along with the improvement of natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning, we were able to have a more natural conversation with the chatbot. However, most of the agent systems including chatbot applications do not consider the user’s feelings. So, the research objective is developing an ontology-based conversation agent system that can analyze and monitor user’s emotional state using the chatbot. And this system can provide an emotion-based service by including the ontology domain knowledge base to the whole system. To recognize the user’s emotional state from various resources, we could consider the social interactions and environmental factors around the user.

After creating a chatbot, the system needs an ontology knowledge base for human-emotion domain. The reason why the knowledge base must be designed based on ontological approach is firstly the system can analyze user’s feeling more intelligently with well-defined emotion ontology. And then we can construct the set of knowledge bases by including other emotion-related domain knowledges and associating with the emotion ontology. Therefore, the system can provide a personalized service (e.g. mental health care, education, or just an entertainment) based on user’s emotion records. This paper proposes an architecture of ontology-based conversational agent system after describing some related works and backgrounds.
